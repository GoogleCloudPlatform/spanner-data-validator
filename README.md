# Spanner Data Validator

This repo contains sample implementations of data validation on Spanner using Apache Beam. Since Spanner is a horizontally scalable database that can scale without limit, we need a framework for data validation that can handle this scale.

## Supported configurations

1. JDBC <=> Spanner (both MySQL and PostgreSQL)
2. Spanner <=> Spanner
